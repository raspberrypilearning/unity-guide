## Install Visual Studio

Unity uses the C# programming language, which is used by professional software developers. To write code for Unity you will need to add an external code editor. 

Many different code editors can be used but the recommended editor is Microsoft Visual Studio. It integrates well with the Unity editor by providing helpful debugging and completing code to reduce typing and errors.
